    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bewley-Huggett-Aiyagari-Imohoroğlu economies are the workhorse of modern macroeconomics. In these economies, markets are \"incomplete\". Agents cannot fully insure against risk and decide to self-insure by holding a safe asset to smooth their consumption (see [Ljungqvist and Sargent (2018)](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/recursive-macroeconomic-theory-fourth-edition) for a textbook treatment of this topic).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, I consider the model of [Aiyagari (1994)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2118417?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents). While the original model abstracts from aggregate fluctuations, Economists have since developed several techniques to simulate out-of-steady-state dynamics for this class of models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, I use a methodology that is quite general. It is a **3-step procedure**, which proceeds as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Solve for the non-stochastic steady-state\n",
    "2. Perturbe the model around its non-stochastic steady-state\n",
    "3. Use the perturbation to calculate out-of-steady-state dynamics\n",
    "\n",
    "I use the [BKM and GenBKM](https://notes.quantecon.org/submission/5ea288cb833c72001a988e4d) algorithms for step 2 and 3, which means that the only theoretical tool needed is **backward induction** (i.e. knowing the value tomorrow, what is the value today?).\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the cons of the methodology presented here? First, the methodology assumes a **small aggregate shock**. An implicit assumption is that aggregate shocks do not modify the value of the non-stochastic steady-state. Said differently, the cycle does not change the trend, [which seems to be violated in some instances](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2X1GiTaxHw). If the shock is large, the value of steady-state may be altered and the methodology presented here is not adequate. An example of a large shock could be the disruption caused by COVID-19.\n",
    "\n",
    "This methodology also fails when the non-stochastic steady-state is not relevant for the dynamic economy. This can problematic in portfolio choice problems, in which portfolios are indeterminate when aggregate uncertainty vanishes (see [Coeurdacier et al (2011)](https://hal-sciencespo.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00972801/document)).\n",
    "\n",
    "On the pro side, the methodology presented here is fast (orders of magnitude faster than [Krusell-Smith (1998)](https://notes.quantecon.org/submission/5bb58d1e11611400157fdc8d)) and transparent. The code can be [downloaded here](https://github.com/JulienPascal/AiyagariAggregateUncertainty)."

    "In the model of Aiyagari (1994), there is continuum of agents each maximizing an infinite flow of discounted utility:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ E_{0} \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\beta^t U(c_t) $$\n",

    "\n",
    "where $Y_t$ is total output, $K_t$ is the aggregate capital level and $L_t$ is the aggregate labor supply. The variables $w_t$ and $r_t$ are pinned down each period by the first order conditions (FOCs) of the representative firm. Note that at the non-stochastic steady-state $z_t = z_{SS} = 1$ (by definition) and both $w_t$ and $r_t$ are constant. Importantly, because agents have to take into consideration the value of $w_t$ and $r_t$ when making decisions, the cross-sectional distribution of agents across capital and idiosyncratic states matters (through the FOCs of the representative firm)."

    "## II. Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve for individual policy functions, I use the endogenous grid method (EGM) of Carroll (2006). The main idea of this method is to start from the end-of-period level of capital. Using the Euler equation, one may recover the beginning-of-period consumption and level of capital without using a root-finding algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the non-stochastic equilibrium, I solve for the fixed-point problem over the aggregate capital level f(K*) = 0 using [Brent's method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brent%27s_method).\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the response of the economy to one-period unforeseen aggregate shock (an \"MIT shock\"), I use a standard backward-forward [\"shooting\" method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_method): \n",
    "1. holding the path of aggregate capital $\\{K_t\\}_{t=1}^{T}$, calculate the policy functions\n",
    "2. holding constant the policy functions, calculate the aggregate capital $\\{K_t\\}_{t=1}^{T}$\n",
    "3. repeat until convergence of the path for aggregate capital $\\{K_t\\}_{t=1}^{T}$\n",
    "\n",
    "To simulate out-of-steady-state dynamics, I use the [BKM algorithm](https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/dyncon/v89y2018icp68-92.html), which relies on the assumption that the response of the economy to an aggregate shock $d_t$ is **linear** with respect to the **aggregate state** $z_t$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ d_t = z_t d(1, 0, 0, ...) + z_{t-1}d(0, 1, 0, ...) + z_{t-2}d(0, 0, 1, ...) + ... $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "or more compactly:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ d_t = \\sum_{k=0}^{+\\infty} z_{t-k} d_{k} $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ d_{1} = d(1,0,0,...)$$\n",
    "$$ d_{2} = d(0,1,0,...)$$\n",
    "$$ d_{3} = d(0,0,1,...)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, the evolution of equilibrium variables is a moving average of past shocks. However, when calculating several trajectories after an MIT shock, one sees that the linearity assumption is slightly violated. Hence, I use the [GenBKM algorithm](https://irihs.ihs.ac.at/id/eprint/4500/), which is a refinement of the BKM algorithm taking into consideration these slight violations of linearity."
